    <h2>Editor's Acknowledgments</h2>
    <p>A great many people have helped bring this book to life. In her original manuscript, Donella (Dana) Meadows extended special thanks to the Balaton Group, the Environmental Systems Analysis Group at Kassel, the Environmental Studies Program at Dartmouth, Ian and Margo Baldwin and Chelsea Green Publishing, Hartmut and Rike Bossel, High Performance Systems (now known as isee systems), and many readers and commentators. She also noted the role of her extended “farm family,” those people who, over the years, lived and worked on her organic farm in Plainfield, New Hampshire.</p>
    <p>As the editor who readied Dana's manuscript for publication after her death, I would like to add more thanks: Ann and Hans Zulliger and the Foundation for the Third Millennium, along with the board and staff of the Sustainability Institute, have contributed support and enthusiasm to this project. Many advisors and reviewers have critiqued the text and models and helped me think through how to make this book useful to the world—Hartmut Bossel, Tom Fiddaman, Chris Soderquist, Phil Rice, Dennis Meadows, Beth Sawin, Helen Whybrow, Jim Schley, Peter Stein, Bert Cohen, Hunter Lovins, and the students at the Presidio School of Management. The entire team at Chelsea Green Publishing have crafted the complex manuscript into a clear book. I thank all of them for their work to help us be better stewards of our home planet.</p>
    <p>And finally, I thank Dana Meadows for all that I have learned from her and through editing this book.</p>
