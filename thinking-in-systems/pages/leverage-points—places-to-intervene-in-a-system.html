    <h1>Leverage Points—Places to Intervene in a System</h1>
    <p class="phrase">IBM . . . announced 25,000 new job cuts and a large reduction in spending on research. . . .Spending on development research is to be lowered by $1 billion next year. . . . Chairman John K. Akers . . . said IBM was still a world and industry leader in research but felt it could do better by “shifting to areas for growth,” meaning services, which need less capital but also return less profit in the long run.<br>

    <p>So, how do we change the structure of systems to produce more of what we want and less of that which is undesirable? After years of working with corporations on their systems problems, MIT's Jay Forrester likes to say that the average manager can define the current problem very cogently, identify the system structure that leads to the problem, and guess with great accuracy where to look for leverage points—places in the system where a small change could lead to a large shift in behavior.</p>
    <p>This idea of leverage points is not unique to systems analysis—it's embedded in legend: the silver bullet; the trimtab; the miracle cure; the secret passage; the magic password; the single hero who turns the tide of history; the nearly effortless way to cut through or leap over huge obstacles. We not only want to believe that there are leverage points, we want to know where they are and how to get our hands on them. Leverage points are points of power.</p>
    <p>But Forrester goes on to point out that although people deeply involved in a system often know intuitively where to find leverage points, more often than not they push the change in the <em>wrong direction</em>.</p>
    <p>The classic example of that backward intuition was my own introduction to systems analysis, the World model. Asked by the Club of Rome—an international group of businessmen, statesmen, and scientists—to show how major global problems of poverty and hunger, environmental destruction, resource depletion, urban deterioration, and unemployment are related and how they might be solved, Forrester made a computer model and came out with a clear leverage point: growth.2 Not only population growth, but economic growth. Growth has costs as well as benefits, and we typically don't count the costs—among which are poverty and hunger, environmental destruction, and so on—the whole list of problems we are trying to solve with growth! What is needed is much slower growth, very different kinds of growth, and in some cases no growth or negative growth.</p>
    <p>The world's leaders are correctly fixated on economic growth as the answer to virtually all problems, <em>but they're pushing with all their might in the wrong direction</em>.</p>
    <p>Another of Forrester's classics was his study of urban dynamics, published in 1969, which demonstrated that subsidized low-income housing is a leverage point.3 The less of it there is, the <em>better off</em> the city is—even the low-income folks in the city. This model came out at a time when national policy dictated massive low-income housing projects, and Forrester was derided. Since then, many of those projects have been torn down in city after city.</p>
    <p><em>Counterintuitive</em>—that's Forrester's word to describe complex systems. Leverage points frequently are not intuitive. Or if they are, we too often use them backward, systematically worsening whatever problems we are trying to solve.</p>
    <p>I have come up with no quick or easy formulas for finding leverage points in complex and dynamic systems. Give me a few months or years and I'll figure it out. And I know from bitter experience that, because they are so counterintuitive, when I do discover a system's leverage points, hardly anybody will believe me. Very frustrating—especially for those of us who yearn not just to understand complex systems, but to make the world work better.</p>
    <p>It was in just such a moment of frustration that I proposed a list of places to intervene in a system during a meeting on the implications of globaltrade regimes. I offer this list to you with much humility and wanting to leave room for its evolution. What bubbled up in me that day was distilled from decades of rigorous analysis of many different kinds of systems done by many smart people. But complex systems are, well, complex. It's dangerous to generalize about them. What you read here is still a work in progress; it's not a recipe for finding leverage points. Rather, it's an invitation to think more broadly about system change.</p>
    <p>As systems become complex, their behavior can become surprising. Think about your checking account. You write checks and make deposits. A little interest keeps flowing in (if you have a large enough balance) and bank fees flow out even if you have no money in the account, thereby creating an accumulation of debt. Now attach your account to a thousand others and let the bank create loans as a function of your combined and fluctuating deposits, link a thousand of those banks into a federal reserve system—and you begin to see how simple stocks and flows, plumbed together, create systems way too complicated and dynamically complex to figure out easily.</p>
    <p>That's why leverage points are often not intuitive. And that's enough systems theory to proceed to the list.</p>
