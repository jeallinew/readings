    <h2>Drift to Low Performance</h2>
    <p class="phrase">In this recession, the British have discovered that . . . the economy is just as downwardly mobile as ever. Even national disasters are now seized on as portents of further decline. The Independent on Sunday carried a front-page article on “the ominous feeling that the Windsor fire is symptomatic of the country at large, that it stems from the new national characteristic of ineptitude.  ”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insisted Lord Peston, Labor's trade and industry spokesman, “We know what we ought to do, for some reason we just don't do it.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Politicians, businessmen, and economists fault the country as a place where the young receive substandard education, where both labor and management are underskilled, where investment is skimped, and where politicians mismanage the economy.<br>

    <p>Some systems not only resist policy and stay in a normal bad state, they keep getting worse. One name for this archetype is “drift to low performance.” Examples include falling market share in a business, eroding quality of service at a hospital, continuously dirtier rivers or air, increased fat in spite of periodic diets, the state of America's public schools—or my onetime jogging program, which somehow just faded away.</p>
    <p>The actor in this feedback loop (British government, business, hospital, fat person, school administrator, jogger) has, as usual, a performance goal or desired system state that is compared to the actual state. If there is a discrepancy, action is taken. So far, that is an ordinary balancing feedback loop that should keep performance at the desired level.</p>
    <p>But in this system, there is a distinction between the actual system state and the perceived state. <em>The actor tends to believe bad news more than good news</em>. As actual performance varies, the best results are dismissed as aberrations, the worst results stay in the memory. The actor thinks things are worse than they really are.</p>
    <p>And to complete this tragic archetype, <em>the desired state of the system is influenced by the perceived state</em>. Standards aren't absolute. When perceived performance slips, the goal is allowed to slip. “Well, that's about all you can expect.” “Well, we're not doing much worse than we were last year.” “Well, look around, everybody else is having trouble too.”</p>
    <p>The balancing feedback loop that should keep the system state at an acceptable level is overwhelmed by a reinforcing feedback loop heading downhill. The lower the perceived system state, the lower the desired state. The lower the desired state, the less discrepancy, and the less corrective action is taken. The less corrective action, the lower the system state. If this loop is allowed to run unchecked, it can lead to a continuous degradation in the system's performance.</p>
    <p>Another name for this system trap is “eroding goals.” It is also called the “boiled frog syndrome,” from the old story (I don't know whether it is true) that a frog put suddenly in hot water will jump right out, but if it is put into cold water that is gradually heated up, the frog will stay there happily until it boils. “Seems to be getting a little warm in here. Well, but then it's not so much warmer than it was a while ago.” Drift to low performance is a gradual process. If the system state plunged quickly, there would be an agitated corrective process. But if it drifts down slowly enough to erase the memory of (or belief in) how much better things used to be, everyone is lulled into lower and lower expectations, lower effort, lower performance.</p>
    <p>There are two antidotes to eroding goals. One is to keep standards absolute, regardless of performance. Another is to make goals sensitive to the best performances of the past, instead of the worst. If perceived performance has an upbeat bias instead of a downbeat one, if one takes the best results as a standard, and the worst results only as a temporary setback, then the same system structure can pull the system up to better and better performance. The reinforcing loop going downward, which said “the worse things get, the worse I'm going to let them get,” becomes a reinforcing loop going upward: “The better things get, the harder I'm going to work to make them even better.”</p>
    <p>If I had applied that lesson to my jogging, I'd be running marathons by now.</p>

        <h4>THE TRAP: DRIFT TO LOW PERFORMANCE</h4>
        <p>Allowing performance standards to be inﬂuenced by past performance, especially if there is a negative bias in perceiving past performance, sets up a reinforcing feedback loop of eroding goals that sets a system drifting toward low performance.</p>
        <h4>THE WAY OUT</h4>
        <p>Keep performance standards absolute. Even better, let standards be enhanced by the best actual performances instead of being discouraged by the worst. Use the same structure to set up a drift toward high performance!</p>
