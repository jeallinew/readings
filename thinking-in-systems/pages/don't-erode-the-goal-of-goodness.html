    <h2>Don't Erode the Goal of Goodness</h2>
    <p>The most damaging example of the systems archetype called “drift to low performance” is the process by which modern industrial culture has eroded the goal of morality. The workings of the trap have been classic, and awful to behold.</p>
    <p>Examples of bad human behavior are held up, magnified by the media, affirmed by the culture, as typical. This is just what you would expect. After all, we're only human. The far more numerous examples of human goodness are barely noticed. They are “not news.” They are exceptions. Must have been a saint. Can't expect everyone to behave like that.</p>
    <p>And so expectations are lowered. The gap between desired behavior and actual behavior narrows. Fewer actions are taken to affirm and instill ideals. The public discourse is full of cynicism. Public leaders are visibly, unrepentantly amoral or immoral and are not held to account. Idealism is ridiculed. Statements of moral belief are suspect. It is much easier to talk about hate in public than to talk about love. The literary critic and naturalist Joseph Wood Krutch put it this way:</p>
    <p class="quote">Thus though man has never before been so complacent about what he <em>has</em>, or so confident of his ability to <em>do</em> whatever he sets his mind upon, it is at the same time true that he never before accepted so low an estimate of what <em>he is</em>. That same scientific method which enabled him to create his wealth and to unleash the power he wields has, he believes, enabled biology and psychology to explain him away—or at least to explain away whatever used to seem unique or even in any way mysterious. . . . Truly he is, for all his wealth and power, poor in spirit.</p>
    <p class="linetab0">We know what to do about drift to low performance. Don't weigh the bad news more heavily than the good. And keep standards absolute.</p>
    <p>Systems thinking can only tell us to do that. It can't do it. We're back to the gap between understanding and implementation. Systems thinking by itself cannot bridge that gap, but it can lead us to the edge of what analysis can do and then point beyond—to what can and must be done by the human spirit.</p>
