    <h2>Model Equations</h2>
    <p>There is much to be learned about systems without using a computer. However, once you have started to explore the behavior of even very simple systems, you may well find that you wish to learn more about building your own formal mathematical models of systems. The models in this book were originally developed using <em>STELLA</em> modeling software, by isee systems Inc. (formerly High Performance Systems). The equations in this section are written to be easily translated into various modeling software, such as <em>Vensim</em> by Ventana Systems Inc. as well as <em>STELLA</em> and <em>iThink</em> by isee systems Inc.</p>
    <p>The following model equations are those used for the nine dynamic models discussed in chapters 1 and 2. “Converters” can be constants or calculations based on other elements of the system model. Time is abbreviated (t) and the change in time from one calculation to the next, the time interval, is noted as (dt).</p>
