    <h2>Go for the Good of the Whole</h2>
    <p>Remember that hierarchies exist to serve the bottom layers, not the top. Don't maximize parts of systems or subsystems while ignoring the whole.

Aim to enhance total systems properties, such as growth, stability, diversity, resilience, and sustainabilityâ€”whether they are easily measured or not.</p>
