    <h2>The Tragedy of the Commons</h2>
    <p class="phrase">Leaders of Chancellor Helmut Kohl’s coalition, led by the Christian Democratic Union, agreed last week with the opposition Social Democrats, after months of bickering, to turn back a flood of economic migrants by tightening conditions for claiming asylum.</br>

    <p>The trap called the tragedy of the commons comes about when there is escalation, or just simple growth, in a commonly shared, erodable environment.</p>
    <p>Ecologist Garrett Hardin described the commons system in a classic article in 1968. Hardin used as his opening example a common grazing land:</br>
        <div class="quote">
            <p>Picture a pasture open to all. It is to be expected that each herdsman will try to keep as many cattle as possible on the commons. . . . Explicitly or implicitly, more or less consciously, he asks, “What is the utility to me of adding one more animal to my herd?”. . .</p>
            <p>Since the herdsman receives all the proceeds from the sale of the additional animal, the positive utility is nearly +1. Since, however, the effects of overgrazing are shared by all, the negative utility for any particular decision-making herdsman is only a fraction of– 1. . . .</p>
            <p>The rational herdsman concludes that the only sensible course for him to pursue is to add another animal to his herd. And another; and another   But this is the conclusion reached by
            each and every rational herdsman sharing a commons. Therein is the tragedy. Each  is locked into a system that compels him to increase his herd without limit—in a world that is limited. Ruin is the destination toward which all  rush, each pursuing his own best interest.</p>
        </div>
    Bounded rationality in a nutshell!</p>
    <p>In any commons system there is, first of all, a resource that is commonly shared (the pasture). For the system to be subject to tragedy, the resource must be not only limited, but erodable when overused. That is, beyond some threshold, the less resource there is, the less it is able to regenerate itself, or the more likely it is to be destroyed. As there is less grass on the pasture, the cows eat even the base of the stems from which the new grass grows. The roots no longer hold the soil from washing away in the rains. With less soil, the grass grows more poorly. And so forth. Another reinforcing feedback loop running downhill.</p>
    <p>A commons system also needs users of the resource (the cows and their owners), which have good reason to increase, and which increase at a rate <em>that is not influenced by the condition of the commons</em>. The individual herdsman has no reason, no incentive, no strong feedback, to let the possibility of overgrazing stop him from adding another cow to the common pasture. To the contrary, he or she has everything to gain.</p>
    <p>The hopeful immigrant to Germany expects nothing but benefit from that country’s generous asylum laws, and has no reason to take into consideration the fact that too many immigrants will inevitably force Germany to toughen those laws. In fact, the knowledge that Germany is discussing that possibility is all the more reason to hurry to Germany!</p>
    <p>The tragedy of the commons arises from <em>missing (or too long delayed) feedback</em> from the resource to the growth of the users of that resource.</p>
    <p>The more users there are, the more resource is used. The more resource is used, the less there is per user. If the users follow the bounded rationality of the commons (“There’s no reason for me to be the one to limit my cows!”), there is no reason for any of them to decrease their use. Eventually, then, the harvest rate will exceed the capacity of the resource to bear the harvest. Because there is no feedback to the user, overharvesting will continue. The resource will decline. Finally, the erosion loop will kick in, the resource will be destroyed, and all the users will be ruined.</p>
    <p>Surely, you’d think, no group of people would be so shortsighted as to destroy their commons. But consider just a few commonplace examples of commons that are being driven, or have been driven, to disaster:</br>
        <ol>
            <li>Uncontrolled access to a popular national park can bring in such crowds that the park’s natural beauties are destroyed.</li>
            <li>It is to everyone’s immediate advantage to go on using fossil fuels, although carbon dioxide from these fuels is a greenhouse gas that is causing global climate change.</li>
            <li>If every family can have any number of children it wants, but society as a whole has to support the cost of education, health care, and environmental protection for all children, the number of children born can exceed the capacity of the society to support them all. (This is the example that caused Hardin to write his article.)</li>
        </ol>
    These examples have to do with overexploitation of renewable resources— a structure you have seen already in the systems zoo. Tragedy can lurk not only in the use of common resources, but also in the use of common sinks, shared places where pollution can be dumped. A family, company, or nation can reduce its costs, increase its profits, or grow faster if it can get the entire community to absorb or handle its wastes. It reaps a large gain, while itself having to live with only a fraction of its own pollution (or none, if it can dump downstream or downwind). There is no rational reason why a polluter should desist. In these cases, the feedback influencing the rate of use of the common resource—whether it is a source or a sink—is weak.
