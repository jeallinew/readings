    <h2>9. Delays—The lengths of time relative to the rates of system changes</h2>
    <p>Delays in feedback loops are critical determinants of system behavior. They are common causes of oscillations. If you're trying to adjust a stock (your store inventory) to meet your goal, but you receive only delayed information about what the state of the stock is, you will overshoot and undershoot your goal. The same is true if your information is timely, but your response isn't. For example, it takes several years to build an electric power plant that will likely last thirty years. Those delays make it impossible to build exactly the right number of power plants to supply rapidly changing demand for electricity. Even with immense effort at forecasting, almost every electricity industry in the world experiences long oscillations between overcapacity and undercapacity. A system just can't respond to short-term changes when it has long-term delays. That's why a massive central-planning system, such as the Soviet Union or General Motors, necessarily functions poorly.</p>
    <p>Because we know they're important, we see delays wherever we look. For example, the delay between the time when a pollutant is dumped on the land and when it trickles down to the groundwater; or the delay between the birth of a child and the time when that child is ready to have a child; or the delay between the first successful test of a new technology and the time when that technology is installed throughout the economy; or the time it takes for a price to adjust to a supply-demand imbalance.</p>
    <p>A delay in a feedback process is critical <em>relative to rates of change in the stocks that the feedback loop is trying to control</em>. Delays that are too short cause overreaction, “chasing your tail,” oscillations amplified by the jumpiness of the response. Delays that are too long cause damped, sustained, or exploding oscillations, depending on how much too long. Overlong delays in a system with a threshold, a danger point, a range past which irreversible damage can occur, cause overshoot and collapse.</p>
    <p>I would list delay length as a high leverage point, except for the fact that delays are not often easily changeable. Things take as long as they take. You can't do a lot about the construction time of a major piece of capital, or the maturation time of a child, or the growth rate of a forest. It's usually easier <em>to slow down the change rate</em>, so that inevitable feedback delays won't cause so much trouble. That's why growth rates are higher up on the leverage-point list than delay times.</p>
    <p>And that's why slowing economic growth is a greater leverage point in Forrester's World model than faster technological development or freer market prices. Those are attempts to speed up the rate of adjustment. But the world's physical capital stock, its factories and boilers, the concrete manifestations of its working technologies, can change only so fast, even in the face of new prices or new ideas—and prices and ideas don't change instantly either, not through a whole global culture. There's more leverage in slowing the system down so technologies and prices can keep up with it, than there is in wishing the delays would go away.</p>
    <p>But if there is a delay in your system that <em>can</em> be changed, changing it can have big effects. Watch out! Be sure you change it in the right direction! (For example, the great push to reduce information and money-transfer delays in financial markets is just asking for wild gyrations.)</p>
