        <tr>
            <th>Archetypes:</th>
            <td>Common system structures that produce characteristic patterns of behavior.</td> 
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Balancing feedback loop:</th>
            <td>A stabilizing, goal-seeking, regulating feedback loop, also know as a “negative feedback loop” because it opposes, or reverses, whatever direction of change is imposed on the system.</td> 
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Bounded rationality:</th>
            <td>The logic that leads to decisions or actions that make sense within one part of a system but are not reasonable within a broader context or when seen as a part of the wider system.</td> 
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Dynamic equilibrium:</th>
            <td>The condition in which the state of a stock (its level or its size) is steady and unchanging, despite inflows and outflows. This is possible only when all inflows equal all outflows.</td> 
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Dynamics:</th>
            <td>The behavior over time of a system or any of its components.</td> 
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Feedback loop:</th>
            <td>The mechanism (rule or information flow or signal) that allows a change in a stock to affect a flow into or out of that same stock. A closed chain of causal connections from a stock, through a set of decisions and actions dependent on the level of the stock, and back again through a flow to change the stock.</td> 
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Flow:</th>
            <td> Material or information that enters or leaves a stock over a period of time.</td> 
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Hierarchy:</th>
            <td>Systems organized in such a way as to create a larger system. Subsystems within systems.</td> 
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Limiting factor:</th>
            <td>A necessary system input that is the one limiting the activity of the system at a particular moment.</td> 
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Linear relationship: </th>
            <td>A relationship between two elements in a system that has constant proportion between cause and effect and so can be drawn with a straight line on a graph. The effect is additive.</td> 
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Nonlinear relationship:</th>
            <td>A relationship between two elements in a system where the cause does not produce a proportional (straight-line) effect.</td> 
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Reinforcing feedback loop:</th>
            <td>An amplifying or enhancing feedback loop, also known as a “positive feedback loop” because it reinforces the direction of change. These are vicious cycles and virtuous circles.</td> 
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Resilience:</th>
            <td>The ability of a system to recover from perturbation; the ability to restore or repair or bounce back after a change due to an outside force.</td> 
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Self-organization:</th>
            <td>The ability of a system to structure itself, to create new structure, to learn, or diversify.</td> 
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Shifting dominance:</th>
            <td>The change over time of the relative strengths of competing feedback loops.</td> 
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Stock:</th>
            <td>An accumulation of material or information that has built up in a system over time.</td> 
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Suboptimization: </th>
            <td>The behavior resulting from a subsystem’s goals dominating at the expense of the total system’s goals.</td> 
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>System:</th>
            <td>A set of elements or parts that is coherently organized and interconnected in a pattern or structure that produces a characteristic set of behaviors, often classified as its “function” or “purpose.”</td>
