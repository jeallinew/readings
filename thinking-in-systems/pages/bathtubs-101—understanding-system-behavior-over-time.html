    <h2>Bathtubs 101—Understanding System Behavior over Time</h2>
    <p class="phrase">Information contained in nature . . . allows us a partial reconstruction of the past......The development of the meanders in a river, the increasing complexity of the earth's crust......are information-storing devices in the same manner that genetic systems are......Storing information means increasing the complexity of the mechanism.<br><span class="right">—Ramon Margalef</span></p>
    <p>A stock is the foundation of any system. Stocks are the elements of the system that you can see, feel, count, or measure at any given time. A system stock is just what it sounds like: a store, a quantity, an accumulation of material or information that has built up over time. It may be the water in a bathtub, a population, the books in a bookstore, the wood in a tree, the money in a bank, your own self-confidence. A stock does not have to be physical. Your reserve of good will toward others or your supply of hope that the world can be better are both stocks.</p>
    <p class="summary"><strong>A stock is the memory of the history of changing ﬂows within the system.</strong></p>
    <p>Stocks change over time through the actions of a flow. Flows are filling and draining, births and deaths, purchases and sales, growth and decay, deposits and withdrawals, successes and failures. A stock, then, is the present memory of the history of changing flows within the system.</p>

        <figcaption><strong>Figure 1. How to read stock-and-ﬂow diagrams.</strong> In this book, stocks are shown as boxes, and ﬂows as arrow-headed “pipes” leading into or out of the stocks. The small T on each ﬂow signiﬁes a “faucet;” it can be turned higher or lower, on or off. The “clouds” stand for wherever the ﬂows come from and go to—the sources and sinks that are being ignored for the purposes of the present discussion.</figcaption>

    <p>For example, an underground mineral deposit is a stock, out of which comes a flow of ore through mining. The inflow of ore into a mineral deposit is minute in any time period less than eons. So I have chosen to draw (Figure 2) a simplified picture of the system without any inflow. <em>All</em> system diagrams and descriptions are simplified versions of the real world.</p>

    <p>Water in a reservoir behind a dam is a stock, into which flow rain and river water, and out of which flows evaporation from the reservoir's surface as well as the water discharged through the dam.</p>

    <p>The volume of wood in the living trees in a forest is a stock. Its inflow is the growth of the trees. Its outflows are the natural deaths of trees and the harvest by loggers. The logging harvest flows into another stock, perhaps an inventory of lumber at a mill. Wood flows out of the inventory stock as lumber sold to customers.</p>

    <p>If you understand the dynamics of stocks and flows—their behavior over time—you understand a good deal about the behavior of complex systems. And if you have had much experience with a bathtub, you understand the dynamics of stocks and flows.</p>

    </figure>
    <p>Imagine a bathtub filled with water, with its drain plugged up and its faucets turned off—an unchanging, undynamic, boring system. Now mentally pull the plug. The water runs out, of course. The level of water in the tub goes down until the tub is empty.</p>

        <h4>A NOTE ON READING GRAPHS OF BEHAVIOR OVER TIME</h3>
        <p>Systems thinkers use graphs of system behavior to understand trends over time, rather than focusing attention on individual events. We also use behavior-over-time graphs to learn whether the system is approaching a goal or a limit, and if so, how quickly.</p>
        <p>The variable on the graph may be a stock or a ﬂow. The pattern—the shape of the variable line—is important, as are the points at which that line changes shape or direction. The precise numbers on the axes are often less important.</p>
        <p>The horizontal axis of time allows you to ask questions about what came before, and what might happen next. It can help you focus on the time horizon appropriate to the question or problem you are investigating.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Now imagine starting again with a full tub, and again open the drain, but this time, when the tub is about half empty, turn on the inflow faucet so the rate of water flowing in is just equal to that flowing out. What happens? The amount of water in the tub stays constant at whatever level it had reached when the inflow became equal to the outflow. It is in a state of dynamic equilibrium—its level does not change, although water is continuously flowing through it.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="../assets/images/1-3-7.png" alt="" height="600em">
        <figcaption><strong>Figure 7.</strong> Constant outﬂow, inﬂow turned on after 5 minutes, and the resulting changes in the stock of water in the tub.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Imagine turning the inflow on somewhat harder while keeping the outflow constant. The level of water in the tub slowly rises. If you then turn the inflow faucet down again to match the outflow exactly, the water in the tub will stop rising. Turn it down some more, and the water level will fall slowly.</p>
    <p>This model of a bathtub is a very simple system with just one stock, one inflow, and one outflow. Over the time period of interest (minutes), I have assumed that evaporation from the tub is insignificant, so I have not included that outflow. All models, whether mental models or mathematical models, are simplifications of the real world. You know all the dynamic possibilities of this bathtub. From it you can deduce several important principles that extend to more complicated systems:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>As long as the sum of all inflows exceeds the sum of all outflows, the level of the stock will rise.</li>
        <li>As long as the sum of all outflows exceeds the sum of all inflows, the level of the stock will fall.</li>
        <li>If the sum of all outflows equals the sum of all inflows, the stock level will not change; it will be held in dynamic equilibrium at whatever level it happened to be when the two sets of flows became equal.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The human mind seems to focus more easily on stocks than on flows. On top of that, when we do focus on flows, we tend to focus on <em>inflows</em> more easily than on outflows. Therefore, we sometimes miss seeing that we can fill a bathtub not only by increasing the inflow rate, but also by decreasing the outflow rate. Everyone understands that you can prolong the life of an oilbased economy by discovering new oil deposits. It seems to be harder to understand that the same result can be achieved by burning less oil. A breakthrough in energy efficiency is equivalent, in its effect on the stock of available oil, to the discovery of a new oil field—although different people profit from it.</p>
    <p class="summary"><strong>A stock can be increased by decreasing its outﬂow rate as well as by increasing its inﬂow rate.</strong> There's more than one way to ﬁll a bathtub!</p>
    <p>Similarly, a company can build up a larger workforce by more hiring, or it can do the same thing by reducing the rates of quitting and firing. These two strategies may have very different costs. The wealth of a nation can be boosted by investment to build up a larger stock of factories and machines. It also can be boosted, often more cheaply, by decreasing the rate at which factories and machines wear out, break down, or are discarded.</p>
    <p>You can adjust the drain or faucet of a bathtub—the flows—abruptly, but it is much more difficult to change the level of water—the stock— quickly. Water can't run out the drain instantly, even if you open the drain all the way. The tub can't fill up immediately, even with the inflow faucet on full blast. A stock takes time to change, because flows take time to flow. That's a vital point, a key to understanding why systems behave as they do. Stocks usually change slowly. They can act as delays, lags, buffers, ballast, and sources of momentum in a system. Stocks, especially large ones, respond to change, even sudden change, only by gradual filling or emptying.</p>
    <p class="summary">Stocks generally change slowly, even when the ﬂows into or out of them change suddenly. Therefore, <strong>stocks act as delays or buffers or shock absorbers in systems.</strong></p>
    <p>People often underestimate the inherent momentum of a stock. It takes a long time for populations to grow or stop growing, for wood to accumulate in a forest, for a reservoir to fill up, for a mine to be depleted. An economy cannot build up a large stock of functioning factories and highways and electric plants overnight, even if a lot of money is available. Once an economy has a lot of oil-burning furnaces and automobile engines, it cannot change quickly to furnaces and engines that burn a different fuel, even if the price of oil suddenly changes. It has taken decades to accumulate the stratospheric pollutants that destroy the earth's ozone layer; it will take decades for those pollutants to be removed.</p>
    <p>Changes in stocks set the pace of the dynamics of systems. Industrialization cannot proceed faster than the rate at which factories and machines can be constructed and the rate at which human beings can be educated to run and maintain them. Forests can't grow overnight. Once contaminants have accumulated in groundwater, they can be washed out only at the rate of groundwater turnover, which may take decades or even centuries.</p>
    <p>The time lags that come from slowly changing stocks can cause problems in systems, but they also can be sources of stability. Soil that has accumulated over centuries rarely erodes all at once. A population that has learned many skills doesn't forget them immediately. You can pump groundwater faster than the rate it recharges for a long time before the aquifer is drawn down far enough to be damaged. The time lags imposed by stocks allow room to maneuver, to experiment, and to revise policies that aren't working.</p>
    <p>If you have a sense of the rates of change of stocks, you don't expect things to happen faster than they can happen. You don't give up too soon. You can use the opportunities presented by a system's momentum to guide it toward a good outcome—much as a judo expert uses the momentum of an opponent to achieve his or her own goals.</p>
    <p>There is one more important principle about the role of stocks in systems, a principle that will lead us directly to the concept of feedback. The presence of stocks allows inflows and outflows to be independent of each other and temporarily out of balance with each other.</p>
    <p class="summary"><strong>Stocks allow inﬂows and outﬂows to be decoupled and to be independent</strong> and temporarily out of balance with each other.</p>
    <p>It would be hard to run an oil company if gasoline had to be produced at the refinery at exactly the rate the cars were burning it. It isn't feasible to harvest a forest at the precise rate at which the trees are growing. Gasoline in storage tanks and wood in the forest are both stocks that permit life to proceed with some certainty, continuity, and predictability, even though flows vary in the short term.</p>
    <p>Human beings have invented hundreds of stock-maintaining mechanisms to make inflows and outflows independent and stable. Reservoirs enable residents and farmers downriver to live without constantly adjusting their lives and work to a river's varying flow, especially its droughts and floods. Banks enable you temporarily to earn money at a rate different from how you spend. Inventories of products along a chain from distributors to wholesalers to retailers allow production to proceed smoothly although customer demand varies, and allow customer demand to be filled even though production rates vary.</p>
    <p>Most individual and institutional decisions are designed to regulate the levels in stocks. If inventories rise too high, then prices are cut or advertising budgets are increased, so that sales will go up and inventories will fall. If the stock of food in your kitchen gets low, you go to the store. As the stock of growing grain rises or fails to rise in the fields, farmers decide whether to apply water or pesticide, grain companies decide how many barges to book for the harvest, speculators bid on future values of the harvest, cattle growers build up or cut down their herds. Water levels in reservoirs cause all sorts of corrective actions if they rise too high or fall too low. The same can be said for the stock of money in your wallet, the oil reserves owned by an oil company, the pile of woodchips feeding a paper mill, and the concentration of pollutants in a lake.</p>
    <p>People monitor stocks constantly and make decisions and take actions designed to raise or lower stocks or to keep them within acceptable ranges. Those decisions add up to the ebbs and flows, successes and problems, of all sorts of systems. Systems thinkers see the world as a collection of stocks along with the mechanisms for regulating the levels in the stocks by manipulating flows.</p>
    <p>That means system thinkers see the world as a collection of “feedback processes.”</p>
